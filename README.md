# Hospital Data Integration System

A web application that helps medical staff monitor patients who have been hospitalized for more than 48 hours without new tests being performed. The system integrates data from the Patient Management System (PMS) and Laboratory Information System (LIS).

## 🩺 Monitoring Logic

The system flags patients who meet the following criteria:

- Currently admitted (no `release_date`)
- Admitted for more than 48 hours
- Last lab test was ordered more than 48 hours ago, or no test was ever ordered

This monitoring helps medical staff identify patients who may need follow-up tests or assessments, ensuring continuous quality of care during hospitalization.

### ⚠️ Clinical Caveat

A patient's latest test may have been ordered more than 48 hours ago, but the result could have been returned recently. While this may still be clinically valid, the patient's condition could have changed since then.

### 🔍 Implementation Note

Therefore:

- We flag the patient for review, but also display:
  - Latest test order timestamp
  - Latest test result timestamp
  - Time since admission

This allows clinicians to make informed decisions based on the complete timeline.

## 🛠️ Database Optimization

### Indexes

Optimized for fast monitoring queries:

1. **Admission Status Index**

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_admission_status ON admissions(patient_id, admission_date, release_date);
   ```

2. **Lab Tests Timeline Index**

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_lab_tests_patient_order_datetime ON lab_tests(patient_id, order_date DESC, order_time DESC);
   ```

3. **Lab Results Timeline Index**

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_lab_results_patient_performed_datetime ON lab_results(test_id, performed_date DESC, performed_time DESC);
   ```

---

### Monitoring View

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW patients_needing_tests AS
WITH
  now AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS now
  ),
  admitted AS (
    SELECT
      admissions.patient_id,
      admissions.hospitalization_case_number,
      admissions.admission_date,
      admissions.admission_time,
      admissions.release_date,
      admissions.release_time,
      admissions.department,
      admissions.room_number
    FROM admissions
    WHERE admissions.release_date IS NULL
  ),
  latest_tests AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (lab_tests.patient_id)
      lab_tests.test_id,
      lab_tests.patient_id,
      lab_tests.test_name,
      lab_tests.order_date + lab_tests.order_time AS last_test_datetime
    FROM lab_tests
    WHERE lab_tests.order_date IS NOT NULL
      AND lab_tests.order_time IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY lab_tests.patient_id, lab_tests.order_date DESC, lab_tests.order_time DESC
  )
SELECT
  p.patient_id,
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name,
  a.hospitalization_case_number,
  p.primary_physician,
  a.admission_date,
  a.admission_time,
  a.department,
  a.room_number,
  now.now - (a.admission_date::timestamp without time zone + a.admission_time::interval)::timestamp with time zone AS time_since_admission,
  lt.last_test_datetime,
  lt.test_name
FROM
  patients p
  JOIN admitted a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
  LEFT JOIN latest_tests lt ON p.patient_id = lt.patient_id,
  now
WHERE
  (now.now - (a.admission_date::timestamp without time zone + a.admission_time::interval)::timestamp with time zone) > INTERVAL '48 hours'
  AND (
    lt.last_test_datetime IS NULL
    OR (now.now - lt.last_test_datetime::timestamp with time zone) > INTERVAL '48 hours'
  );
```

## 📌 Key Points

- Uses CTEs for clarity and maintainability
- Caches current timestamp for consistency
- Flags patients early for review
- Includes timestamps and hospitalization details
- Calculates time since admission and last test
- Supports clinical decision-making

## 🐞 Known Data Issues

### Duplicate `test_id` Values in CSVs

While validating `lab_tests.csv` and `lab_results.csv`, duplicate `test_id` values were identified, assigned to different lab tests.  
This breaks the one-to-one mapping assumption between tests and results, leading to potential mismatches and clinical inaccuracies.
